APP NAME: PRIORITIZE YOURSELF

This app was created using Swift via Playgrounds. Please ensure that the following files are present: PriorYour, OpenScreen ContentView, AppName, and Logo.

Opening Screen: When a user first launches the app, they should see the logo ("PY"), a button that says "Schedule" and the name of the app at the bottom, "Prioritize Yourself". In order to advance to the next screen, the user should press the schedule button.

Menu: After pressing the menu button, you are given three options to click on: "Add Task", "Schedule", and "View All Tasks".

Add Task: Here the user has different fields to input. There is "Task Name", which you can name the task you want to input into your calendar, for example, "Math Pset" or "CS50 Final Project". The next field gives you three different options of difficulty level. It is automatically set to easy, but you can choose between easy, moderate, and difficult based on your opinion. For example, if math is an easy class for you and the psets are something you can accomplish quickly, a user should input easy. However, if you have a really long research paper to do and find it a bit taunting, then the user should input difficult. The last field is due date, and you just insert the date that the task is due. Press enter once all fields are complete. Pressing enter will take you back to the main menu but if you go to the add task page and want to go back, you can simply press the green arrow in the upper left corner of the screen.

Schedule: Pressing schedule, presents the weekly calendar from Sunday to Saturday, with the addition of all the tasks you have input via the "Add Task" page. Here in schedule it gives you an idea of what tasks you should aim to work on/do each day. If you press on a task, you will have the option to "Mark as Complete", which will mark it as complete in the "View All Tasks" page, or to "Delete", which will remove the task from the schedule. To exit out of the schedule you can simply press the green arrow in the upper left corner of the screen.

View All Tasks: Here you have a list version of all your tasks. They are categorized as either "To Do" or "Completed". There are two ways to mark a task as complete. You can either do it by going to the schedule directly and pressing on the task, which will prompt you to either mark it as complete or delete it or you can press "Complete" next to the task name, which will then remove the task from under To Do and move it under Complete.
